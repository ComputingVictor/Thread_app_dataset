## Description

This repository contains analyses and models based on the "Thread app dataset: 37000 entities," encompassing over 37,000 reviews from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store about the New Thread mobile application.

## Repository Contents
- 1_ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset, including visualizations and descriptive statistics.
Upcoming Work
- NLP Transformation: Planned transformation and preprocessing of the text contained within the reviews are underway to extract features and prepare the data for modeling.

- Ratings Predictive Analysis: In the upcoming weeks, Machine Learning models, RNNs, and potentially LLM will be implemented to predict user ratings based on the content of their reviews.

## Data Source
The original dataset can be found on Kaggle: [Thread app dataset: 37000 entities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuvammandal121/37000-reviews-of-thread-app-dataset).
